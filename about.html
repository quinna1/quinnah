                    <p id="paragraph"><br>Hi, I'm Quinna. I was born in Boston, grew up in Jakarta, and relocated some 10,000 miles to the suburbs of Detroit. This summer, I'll be spending six weeks in Chengdu, China for a study abroad program as I continue my search for new experiences outside of my comfort zone.</br>
			<br>As a kid, I used to spend hours poring over maps and travel guides (a quirk that led me to runner-up in the middle school geography bee without any formal preparation) and even concocted my own cities, loosely based off ones I knew only through travel guides. Now as I move to the adult world, I aspire to combine my love for tech and cities through the emerging field of urban science, the study of applying big data to big problems in big cities.</br>
			<br>Outside of that, you can find me writing short stories, running in the rain, and trying exotic flavors of everything (matcha and taro are my obsessions). I'm also passionate about <a href="https://medium.com/riseyala/the-other-asians-e03f38d5a5df">Asian-American advocacy</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@hquinna/the-untold-side-of-immigration-730a86e67090">immigration rights</a>.</br>
